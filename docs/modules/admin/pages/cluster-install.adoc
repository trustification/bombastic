== Creating a "values file"

The Helm chart requires a set of information which the user needs to provide, and for which there are no defaults. For
this it is required to create a "values" file, amending the default values. The values file has to be provided when
performing the installation.

The values files is a simple YAML file, which has a structure defined by the JSON schema of the Helm chart.

TIP: As the chart offers a JSON schema, using an editor/IDE with supports for Helm Charts and JSON schema will make
it easier creating the file, as it will show schema violations and offer code completion while editing.

=== Providing secrets

The chart allows providing secrets either by providing the actual value, or by providing a reference to a secret.

Taking the storage configuration as an example, it requires the following credentials:

[source,yaml]
----
storage:
  accessKey: …
  secretKey: …
----

For both `accessKey` as well as `secretKey`, the information can be provided as either a direct value, or as a
reference. Also, a mixed version possible. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
storage:
  accessKey: "12345" # <1>
  secretKey:
    valueFrom:
      secretValueRef:
        name: secret-name # <2>
        key: secret-key # <3>
----
<1> A literal value for the access key
<2> The name of the secret containing the secret key value
<3> The name of the key the containing the value inside the secret

NOTE: The helm chart will only reference the values. It will not create the secrets or update the deployments when
the values of the secrets change. In the case of using a plain value, a changed value will result in a changed
deployment, and thus Kubernetes will perform a new rollout with the changed value.

TIP: When using the object form, it is possible to provide the object one would provide for a Kubernetes `envVar`
object, including `value` and `valueFrom`. For more information, see the Kubernetes documentation.

=== A reasonable values file

The following values file is a reasonable example. If you used the OpenTofu method of setting up the AWS resources,
all secrets are already created in the expected format of the values files and no modifications of the secrets
are required.

Otherwise, you will need to create these secrets yourself with the information noted during the manual creation of
the resources.

[source, yaml]
----
include::../examples/values-ocp-aws.yaml[]
----
<1> Application domain, will be provided from the CLI
<2> AWS region
<3> URL of the Cognito domain
<4> The OIDC issuer URL
<5> Client ID of the frontend client
<6> Client ID of the walker client

NOTE: The example values file contains some placeholders in the format of `<name>`. Those placeholders must be replaced
with actual values.

== Create a new namespace

Create a new namespace for the deployment. In the examples we will assume it is named `trustification`. You can
create it from the command line using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create ns trustification
----

== Running the Helm installation

Once the values file is generated and the namespace is created, run the Helm chart by executing:

[source,bash]
----
NAMESPACE=trustification # <1>
APP_DOMAIN=-$NAMESPACE.$(kubectl -n openshift-ingress-operator get ingresscontrollers.operator.openshift.io default -o jsonpath='{.status.domain}')
helm upgrade --install -n $NAMESPACE trustification charts/trustification --values <values-file> --set-string appDomain=$APP_DOMAIN # <2>
----
<1> The name of the namespace you created for the deployment
<2> The name of the "values" file

TIP: The command is actually a mix of "install or upgrade". Which means that you can re-run it multiple times, and it
will apply the currently configured state from the values file.
