= Preparing the environment

The deployment requires a few services outside the Kubernetes based infrastructure. This includes:

* S3 storage
* Change events from S3 to SQS/SNS
* A PostgreSQL database instance
* A set of OIDC clients for frontend and backend authentication

The following sections will explain what is required in more detail. Each step will result in some information
which needs to be captured and which needs to be used later on in the Helm chart's values file.

[NOTE]
.AWS regions
====
While it is possible to split the AWS services to different regions, that might have an impact on the cost of running
the services, as well as on the performance. Therefore, it is recommended to keep everything in a single region. The
rest of the document will assume that this is the case.
====

In the following sections the document will refer to "document types". The expectation is that those are the document
types: SBOMs, CSAF documents, CVEs. For creating S3 resources, we will use the following naming pattern:

* `bombastic` for SBOMs
* `vexination` for CSAF documents
* `v11y` for CVEs

Examples will use a placeholder of the format `<type>` when it is necessary to replace this with the actual types.

[#s3_storage]
== S3 storage

It is required to set up three S3 buckets, each with the same configuration:

* For storing SBOMs
* For storing CSAF documents
* For storing CVE detail information

From here on, the examples will use:

* `bombastic` for the SBOM bucket
* `vexination` for the CSAF document bucket
* `v11y` for the CVE details bucket

== Event queues

For each bucket created in <<s3_storage>>, the following three SQS queues have to be created:

* A queue for receiving events when a new document was stored
* A queue for receiving events when a document was indexed successfully
* A queue for receiving events when a document could not be processed

It is recommended to follow the following pattern:

* `<type>-stored` For events when a new document was stored
* `<type>-indexed` For events when a document was indexed successfully
* `<type>-failed` For events when a document could not be processed
* `<type>-guac` For events when a document should be processed by GUAC

NOTE: There is one exception to that rule. GUAC does not require notifications for CVE documents. So the topic
`v11y-guac` must not be created.

This will result in the following names, which will be used from here on for examples in this document:

* `bombastic-stored`
* `bombastic-indexed`
* `bombastic-failed`
* `bombastic-guac`
* `vexination-stored`
* `vexination-indexed`
* `vexination-failed`
* `vexination-guac`
* `v11y-stored`
* `v11y-indexed`
* `v11y-failed`

== S3 change notifications

For each bucket a change notification needs to be set up publish the events for `s3:ObjectCreated:*` and
`s3:ObjectRemoved:*` to the `<type>-stored-topic` topic.

For this we need to set up a topic (named `<type>-stored-topic`) as well as a bucket notification, publishing to that
topic. This bucket notification must publish events for: `["s3:ObjectCreated:*", "s3:ObjectRemoved:*"]`.

This also requires granting the S3 bucket access to the topic. For example:

[source,json5]
----
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "SNS:Publish",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:*:*:*",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnEquals": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::bombastic" // <1>
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----
<1> S3 bucket name

== Queue subscriptions

In order to deliver those change events, we need to connect the change topic to the `<type>-stored` and `<type>-guac`
queue by creating "topic subscriptions".

There should be two subscriptions for each document type of the protocol type `SQS`, using "raw message delivery":

* Topic: `<type>-stored` -> `<type>-stored`
* `<type>-stored` -> `<type>-guac`

NOTE: There is one exception to that rule. The `v11y-stored-topic` does not need to be connected to the `v11y-guac`
as it does not exist.

This also requires granting the S3 SNS topic access to the queue. For example:

[source,json5]
----
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:*:*",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnEquals": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:sns:region:123456789012:bombastic-stored" // <1>
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----
<1> Name of the SNS topic

== Users

For each document type an AWS IAM user must be created. From here on, the examples will use:

* `bombastic`
* `vexination`
* `v11y`

For each user an access key must be created.

Also does each user require access to its S3 bucket and corresponding queues. For example for the SBOM user (`bombastic`):

[source,json5]
----
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "sqs:SendMessage",
                "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
                "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
                "sqs:DeleteMessage"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:*:bombastic-*" // <1>
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bombastic" // <2>
        }
    ]
}
----
