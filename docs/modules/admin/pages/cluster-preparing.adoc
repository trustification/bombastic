= Preparing the environment

The deployment requires a few services outside the Kubernetes based infrastructure. This includes:

* S3 storage
* Change events from S3 to SQS/SNS
* A PostgreSQL database instance
* A set of OIDC clients for frontend and backend authentication

Setting up those resources is explained in <<manually_creating_resources>>. However, if you're just looking for a
quick way to generate all those resources, see <<opentofu_terraform>> for some automation.

[#opentofu_terraform]
== OpenTofu / Terraform

This describes an opinionated way to set up all AWS resources quickly using OpenTofu. Be sure to inspect the scripts
before running them.

[NOTE]
.OpenTofu vs Terraform
====
OpenTofu is the open source fork of Terraform. While it should be possible to also use Terraform, Trustification focuses
on OpenTofu. If you prefer Terraform, replace the `tofu` commands with `terraform`.
====

=== Pre-requisites

You will need:

* The AWS CLI and OpenTofu CLI installed
* An AWS account configured with the AWS CLI
* An OpenShift cluster already set up in the same AWS region/profile/account

=== Preparing

You will also need to create a wrapper/main module referencing the `trustification` module. A simple wrapper module
(named `main.tf`) should look like this:

NOTE: The following example file needs to be adapted to your needs. Example values have to be replaced with values
that suit your deployment.

[source,hcl-terraform]
----
provider "aws" {
  region  = "<your region>"  # <1>
  profile = "<your aws cli profile>" # <2>
}

provider "kubernetes" {
  config_path    = "<path to kubeconfig>" # <3>
  config_context = "<name of the kubectl context>" # <4>
}

variable "app-domain" {
  type = string
}

module "trustification" {
  source = "./trustification" # <5>

  cluster-vpc-id = "<your cluster vpc>" # <6>
  availability-zone = "<your availability zone inside your region>" # <7>

  namespace = "trustification"

  admin-email = "<your e-mail address>" # <8>
  sso-domain = "<a free cognito console domain name>" # <9>
  console-url = "https://console${var.app-domain}"
}
----
<1> The AWS region you want to create the resources in
<2> The name of the AWS CLI profile you want to use
<3> The location to the "kubeconfig" file, required for accessing the Kubernetes cluster
<4> The name of the Kubernetes client context (in the `kubeconfig`) to use
<5> The location of the `trustification` Terraform module
<6> The VPC ID of the OpenShift cluster, used to allow access to the RDS database
<7> The availability zone the RDS instance should be created in. Must be valid for the AWS region.
<8> The e-mail of the admin user, which will get frontend access to Trustification
<9> An AWS Cognito domain prefix. It is globally unique and has to be still available.

=== Creating the resources

First, initialize the OpenTofu instance. This will set up the required providers and does not yet create any resources:

[source,bash]
----
tofu init
----

The following commands require the environment variable `APP_DOMAIN` to be set. You can do this using the following
command:

[source,bash]
----
NAMESPACE=trustification
APP_DOMAIN=-$NAMESPACE.$(kubectl -n openshift-ingress-operator get ingresscontrollers.operator.openshift.io default -o jsonpath='{.status.domain}')
----

Then, check if the resources can be created. This also does not yet create the resources:

[source,bash]
----
tofu plan --var app-domain=$APP_DOMAIN
----

This will show you the resources which will get created and check if the creation is expected to be successful.

If this worked fine, proceed with actually creating the resources:

[source,bash]
----
tofu apply --var app-domain=$APP_DOMAIN
----

=== Extracting information

Most secrets required for the deployment of Trustification have already been created in the Kubernetes cluster as
`Secrets`. The next step will use those generated secrets by default.

If you are using AWS Cognito, you will also need to transfer the following information to the Helm chart values file
manually:

* The issuer URL
* The client IDs of the OIDC clients
* The Cognito hosted UI domain

The following is an example snippet of the relevant sections (values in the format `<value>` are expected to be replaced
with their actual values):

[source,yaml]
----
authenticator:
  type: cognito
  cognitoDomainUrl: https://<cognito-domain>.auth.<region>.amazoncognito.com # <1>

oidc:
  issuerUrl: https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<cognito issuer id> # <2>
  clients:
    frontend:
      clientId: <frontend client id> # <3>
    walker:
      clientId: <walker client id> # <3>
      clientSecret:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: oidc-walker
            key: client-secret
----
<1> The Cognito hosted UI domain URL.
<2> The URL of the issuer. A combination of the region and the issuer ID.
<3> The OIDC client IDs

All information can be found in the AWS console.

[#manually_creating_resources]
== Manually creating the resources

The following sections will explain what is required in more detail. Some steps will result in some information
which needs to be captured and which needs to be used later on in the Helm chart's values file.

[NOTE]
.AWS regions
====
While it is possible to split the AWS services to different regions, that might have an impact on the cost of running
the services, as well as on the performance.Therefore, it is recommended to keep everything in a single region.The
rest of the document will assume that this is the case.
====

In the following sections the document will refer to "document types". The expectation is that those are the document
types: SBOMs, CSAF documents, CVEs. For creating S3 resources, we will use the following naming pattern:

* `bombastic` for SBOMs
* `vexination` for CSAF documents
* `v11y` for CVEs

Examples will use a placeholder of the format `<type>` when it is necessary to replace this with the actual types.

[#s3_storage]
=== S3 storage

It is required to set up three S3 buckets, each with the same configuration:

* For storing SBOMs
* For storing CSAF documents
* For storing CVE detail information

From here on, the examples will use:

* `bombastic` for the SBOM bucket
* `vexination` for the CSAF document bucket
* `v11y` for the CVE details bucket

=== Event queues

For each bucket created in <<s3_storage>>, the following three SQS queues have to be created:

* A queue for receiving events when a new document was stored
* A queue for receiving events when a document was indexed successfully
* A queue for receiving events when a document could not be processed

It is recommended to follow the following pattern:

* `<type>-stored` For events when a new document was stored
* `<type>-indexed` For events when a document was indexed successfully
* `<type>-failed` For events when a document could not be processed
* `<type>-guac` For events when a document should be processed by GUAC

NOTE: There is one exception to that rule. GUAC does not require notifications for CVE documents. So the topic
`v11y-guac` must not be created.

This will result in the following names, which will be used from here on for examples in this document:

* `bombastic-stored`
* `bombastic-indexed`
* `bombastic-failed`
* `bombastic-guac`
* `vexination-stored`
* `vexination-indexed`
* `vexination-failed`
* `vexination-guac`
* `v11y-stored`
* `v11y-indexed`
* `v11y-failed`

=== S3 change notifications

For each bucket a change notification needs to be set up publish the events for `s3:ObjectCreated:*` and
`s3:ObjectRemoved:*` to the `<type>-stored-topic` topic.

For this we need to set up a topic (named `<type>-stored-topic`) as well as a bucket notification, publishing to that
topic. This bucket notification must publish events for: `["s3:ObjectCreated:*", "s3:ObjectRemoved:*"]`.

This also requires granting the S3 bucket access to the topic. For example:

[source,json5]
----
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "SNS:Publish",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:*:*:*",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnEquals": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::bombastic" // <1>
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----
<1> S3 bucket name

=== Queue subscriptions

In order to deliver those change events, we need to connect the change topic to the `<type>-stored` and `<type>-guac`
queue by creating "topic subscriptions".

There should be two subscriptions for each document type of the protocol type `SQS`, using "raw message delivery":

* Topic: `<type>-stored` -> `<type>-stored`
* `<type>-stored` -> `<type>-guac`

NOTE: There is one exception to that rule. The `v11y-stored-topic` does not need to be connected to the `v11y-guac`
as it does not exist.

This also requires granting the S3 SNS topic access to the queue. For example:

[source,json5]
----
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:*:*",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnEquals": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:sns:region:123456789012:bombastic-stored" // <1>
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----
<1> Name of the SNS topic

=== Users

For each document type an AWS IAM user must be created. From here on, the examples will use:

* `bombastic`
* `vexination`
* `v11y`

For each user an access key must be created.

Also does each user require access to its S3 bucket and corresponding queues. For example for the SBOM user (`bombastic`):

[source,json5]
----
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "sqs:SendMessage",
                "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
                "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
                "sqs:DeleteMessage"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:*:bombastic-*" // <1>
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bombastic" // <2>
        }
    ]
}
----
<1> SQS queues
<2> S3 bucket

=== RDS

Also, a PostgreSQL instance of RDS is required. The instance must be accessible from the cluster you're installing
Trustification on. The actual RDS size (CPU, RAM, Storage, …) depends on the amount of data you are considering to
store in the system.

In order to try out Trustification, a single instance of type `db.m7g.large` will be sufficient.

=== Keycloak

Trustification requires an OIDC issuer. The recommended setup to use Keycloak as OIDC issuer. For this, you will need
to:

* Install Keycloak
* Create a new realm
* Create the following roles for this realm
    ** `chicken-user`
    ** `chicken-manager`
    ** `chicken-admin`
* Make the `chicken-user` a default role
* Create the following scopes for this realm
    ** `read:document`
    ** `create:document`
    ** `delete:document`
* Add the `create:document` and `delete:document` scope to the `chicken-manager` role
* Create two clients
    ** One public client
        *** Set `standardFlowEnabled` to `true`
        *** Set `fullScopedAllowed` to `true`
        *** Set the following `defaultClientScopes`
            **** `read:document`
            **** `create:document`
            **** `delete:document`
    ** One protected client
        *** Set `publicClient` to `false`
        *** Set `serviecAccountsEnabled` to `true`
        *** Set `fullScopedAllowed` to `true`
        *** Set the following `defaultClientScopes`
            **** `read:document`
            **** `create:document`
        *** Add role `chicken-manager` to the service account of this client
    ** Increase the token timeout for both clients to at least 5 minutes
* Create a user, acting as administrator
    ** Add the `chicken-manager` and `chicken-admin` role to this user
