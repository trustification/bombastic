= Search and retrieve

Trustification allows searching SBOM and VEX data using a builtin search engine so that you can find relevant data quickly. Once found,
you can also retrieve the original SBOM and VEX data.

You can use either the UI or the REST API for searching data in both Bombastic and Vexination.

== UI

The Spog UI can be used to search link:https://trustification.dev/advisory/[advisories] or link:https://trustification.dev/package/[packages]. See the query language description
below for example queries.

== REST APIs

There are three REST APIs that you can use for searching. They differ in what data they search and the expected flow.

* Spog - this is the API is focused on the needs of the UI and might make queries to multiple underlying sources.
* Bombastic - this API can be used to search and retrieve SBOM data only.
* Vexination - this API can be used to search VEX data only.

=== Spog API

The Spog API can be searched and retrieved using the following paths:

* `GET /api/v1/package/search?q=<query>`
* `GET /api/v1/advisory/search?q=<query>`
* `GET /api/v1/package/search?q=<query>`
* `GET /api/v1/package?id=<package id>`

Examples:

* link:https://api.trustification.dev/api/v1/advisory/search?q=openssl[]
* link:https://api.trustification.dev/api/v1/advisory?id=RHSA-2023:1441[]

=== Bombastic API

The Bombastic API can be searched for SBOM data using the following paths:

* `GET /api/v1/sbom/search?q=<query>`
* `GET /api/v1/sbom?id=<SBOM id>`

Examples:

* link:https://sbom.trustification.dev/api/v1/sbom/search?q=openssl[]
* link:https://sbom.trustification.dev/api/v1/sbom?id=vertx-4.0[]

=== Vexination API

The Vexination API can be searched VEX data using the following paths:

* `GET /api/v1/vex/search?q=<query>`
* `GET /api/v1/vex?id=<advisory id>`

Examples:

* link:https://vex.trustification.dev/api/v1/vex/search?q=openssl[]
* link:https://vex.trustification.dev/api/v1/vex?id=RHSA-2023:1441[]

== Query language

The search query language is based on link:https://github.com/ctron/sikula[Sikula], which is modelled after the GitHub search syntax. The fields that can be referenced in the query depend on which source is being searched.

In general, any free form text will search titles, descriptions for the documents and return the matches that the search engine thinks is best.

You can search in specific fields such as title using `<query> in:title`. You can also use ranges for date fields: `release:2022-01-01..2022-12-31`.

Each service also allow some short-hand predictates that can be specified using `is:<predicate>`.

=== Vexination fields

* `id` look at the advisory identifier.
* `cve` CVE vulnerability id mentioned in advisory.
* `title` Advisory or CVE title.
* `description` Advisory or CVE description.
* `status` Advisory status.
* `cvss` CVSS scores.
* `package` Affected or fixed packages/products mentioned in product status.
* `affected` Affected packages/products mentioned in CVEs.
* `fixed` Fixed packages/products mentioned in CVEs.
* `release` Advisory or CVE release date.
* `discovery` Advisory or CVE discovery date.

In addition there are a few predicates:

* `critical` - CVE in critical category.
* `high` - CVE in high category.
* `medium` - CVE in medium category.
* `low` - CVE in low category.

=== Bombastic fields

* `package-name` SBOM package name.
* `purl` SBOM package URL.
* `cpe` SBOM product identifier.
* `description` SBOM description.
* `digest` Artifact digest of package or dependency in SBOM.
* `dependency` Package name, package URL or CPE of dependency.
* `license` License of package or dependency.

=== Examples

* Searching for vulnerabilities mentioning log4j in default fields: link:https://vex.trustification.dev/api/v1/vex?q=log4j[log4j].
* Searching for vulnerabilities mentioning java the past 30 days: link:https://vex.trustification.dev/api/v1/vex?q=java+release%3A%3E2023-05-03[java release:>2023-05-03].
* Searching for packages mentioning openssl: link:https://sbom.trustification.dev/api/v1/sbom?q=openssl[openssl].
