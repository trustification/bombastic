The Trustification project is a collection of software components that enables you to store and retrieve Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), and Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) information.
Developers can use this information to learn about common security vulnerabilities, and dependency changes within their software supply chain.

Trustification can do the following:

* Store SBOM and VEX documents for your software, and its dependencies.
* Discover, and learn the state of vulnerabilities related to your software.
* Explore SBOM and VEX documents by using search queries.
* Share access to your SBOM and VEX information with others.
