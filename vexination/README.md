# Vexination

Vexination is a storage and archival service for Vulnerability EXchange (VEX) files.

## Architecture

The overall design follows a (micro)-services architecture, where each component in the architecture can have clearly defined service boundaries and may be replaced independently of the other components. See [bombastic](../bombastic/README.md) which shares a lot with Vexination.
